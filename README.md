### Background

The current process for pricing Airbnb accommodations is often inconsistent, leading to listings that are either 
overpriced and stay vacant or underpriced, causing potential revenue loss for hosts. 

This project aims to identify the key factors influencing Airbnb pricing using an extensive dataset of global accommodations. By understanding what drives pricing variability and how it impacts revenue, we aim to develop a model that helps hosts price their properties competitively and realistically. This will enhance hosts' revenue optimization strategies and improve occupancy rates.
